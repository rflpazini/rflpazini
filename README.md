### How you doin'? ðŸ¤—

My goal is to collaborate with forward-thinking companies that leverage cutting-edge technologies to drive meaningful, lasting change in society.

âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™m not just into software engineering and tech, Iâ€™m also a huge coffee enthusiast, 3D printing nerd, and Iâ€™ve got a thing for the classic VW Beetle. When Iâ€™m not coding or scaling apps, Iâ€™m probably experimenting with new coffee brewing methods or printing out some cool miniatures. Oh, and I somehow manage to balance all that with creating content to help other developers level up their skills. Tech, coffee, 3D printing, and vintage carsâ€”whatâ€™s not to love?
